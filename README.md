Welcome to the official build of the web version for the Taxi Maths calculator. If you're here from the TikTok video, you've come to the right place.

## Made with ❤️ in:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

What started as a personal JavaScript exercise to bring an idea to reality quickly, just to maintain consistency on my social media, received so much attention that I decided to invest more time in developing a finished product based on the feedback of my followers. This venture led me to many more clients who approached me for their projects. Although not the most advanced, this project holds a special place in my heart. The mobile version for Android and iOS is currently in development.

## Optimizations

To be honest, a lot of code can be minimized by following the DRY rule (Don't Repeat Yourself), as the code was written hastily to get something into production. Using classes that can be replicated for the input fields would polish it up nicely.

## Lessons Learned

As much as having a perfect project is important and desirable, having something you can show for prototyping is equally valuable. Perfection can cause delays in progress. It's better to have something good than not having anything at all.

## Examples
