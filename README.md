## Made with love in:
**HTML** ,
**CSS** ,
**JavaScript**

What started out as a personal  Javscript excercise to flesh out an idea i had to reality as quickly as i can just to keep my social media consistant recieved soo much attention that 
i just had to invest more time into developing a finished product based on the feedback of my followers. This lead me to many more clients who approached me for their own project. This one, though not the most advanced, means that this project has a special place in my heart. The mobile version for android and ios is currently; in development.

## Optimizations

To be honest a lot of the can be minimized using by following the DRY rule (Don't repeat yourself) as the code was written in a hurry to get something in productin. Uses of classes that can be replicated for the input fields would polish it up nicely.

## Lessons Learned:
As much as having a perfect project is important and desirable, having something you can show just for prototyping is desired as perfection can cause people to delay on progress. It's better to have something that's good that not having anything at all. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
